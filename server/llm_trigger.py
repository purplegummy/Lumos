"""Trigger logic for the LLM intervention condition.

Three responsibilities live here, kept small so the socket layer never changes
when the trigger policy does:

1. evaluate_trigger -- the realtime dwell decision. Readiness, recheck spacing AND
   SCORING are all PER VARIABLE, measured on each variable's OWN eligible dwell history:
   a hover counts toward variable v only if v was active (on an axis or filtered) AT THE
   MOMENT of that specific hover (eligible_dwell_by_teen_by_var). A variable is checkable
   once it has accumulated MIN_ELIGIBLE_DWELL_SECONDS of its own eligible dwell
   (first-check floor) and DWELL_RECHECK_SECONDS of NEW eligible dwell since its own last
   check (recheck spacing) -- so a variable can be active right now yet still not ready if
   its own history is thin, and one variable's dwell never advances another's clock. Each
   ready variable is then scored INDEPENDENTLY -- dc_adapter re-pools DC onto that ONE
   variable and dc_metric.dwell_bias_percentile scores it against THAT variable's own
   per-teen dwell -- and the single winner is chosen by the shared priority hierarchy
   (_reduce_by_priority), exactly as the selection trigger picks its target. Ready
   variables are NEVER pooled into one joint score. should_trigger is a thin bool wrapper
   for callers that don't need the reason.

2. evaluate_selection_trigger -- the live mid-task decision: the progressive trigger
   (3) held to a fixed pick schedule (a check at the 5th selection and every
   SELECTION_RECHECK_PICKS after: 5th, 7th, 9th), whether or not an earlier check
   fired.

3. evaluate_selection_progressive_trigger -- a per-selection sibling of the realtime
   dwell trigger (1), scoring the running selection per variable and reducing to one
   winner by the shared priority hierarchy. The scoring is SCOPED to the currently-active
   variables (x/y axes + active filters, via _axis_and_filter_vars) -- the same active set
   the dwell trigger uses -- so a variable the participant is not looking at or filtering
   on neither earns nor blocks a fire. Reached live only through
   evaluate_selection_trigger (2).

Both triggers (1) and (3) now share three helpers rather than each owning a copy:
_axis_and_filter_vars (the active set kept SPLIT into its axis/filter tiers, which the
hierarchy needs), _confidence_for_var, and _reduce_by_priority (the threshold-then-rank
reduction). Dwell and selection differ in HOW the per-variable percentiles are computed;
they agree entirely on how a winner is picked from them.

This module reads from dc_metric (scoring) plus dc_adapter (the scoped-map reshape)
and llm_intervention (get_current_axes / get_current_filters); it modifies none of them.
The per-variable eligible-dwell replay (eligible_dwell_by_teen_by_var /
filters_active_as_of) lives here rather than in dc_adapter so it can reuse
get_current_filters' replay rules (via a bounded prefix) without dc_adapter having to
import the heavier llm_intervention.

# The system-wide gate is a DISPLAY-LINKED PAUSE, not a duration: CLOSED from the moment
# a fire is decided, and open again only once the participant's panel has actually gone
# away (on_llm_dismissed -> release_display_pause). It replaces a fixed 30s wall clock,
# per the study lead -- "paused while the panel is visible, resumes when it disappears". A
# participant who reads a nudge for 8s and closes it should not then sit through 22s of
# nothing; one who leaves it up should not have the clock run out underneath it.
#
# It opens at the FIRE DECISION rather than at the emit, deliberately: the ~5s generation
# happens before any panel exists, so a gate that only closed on display would let a
# second fire start during it -- two generations, two panels, the first replaced before
# it could be read.
#
# PANEL_FLAG_WATCHDOG_MS is a BACKSTOP, not a policy value. The clear is client-
# originated, so it is not guaranteed to arrive: a refresh mid-panel, a socket that drops
# before the dismiss flushes, or a generation that dies past the point the caller can
# react all leave the flag set with no panel behind it. The old fixed duration healed
# those by expiring; nothing else does, so a flag older than this bound is cleared at the
# gate rather than obeyed. Sized to be unreachable legitimately: 30s of panel display
# (the frontend's own LLM_PANEL_TIMEOUT_MS auto-dismiss) + 20s of generation
# (llm_intervention.GENERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS) = 50s worst case, rounded generously to
# two minutes. Erring long only delays recovery from a fault; erring short would reopen
# the gate under a panel still being read, which is the behaviour this replaced.

    The time-bounded generalization of llm_intervention.get_current_filters, which

    before bound_ms and delegates to the unmodified get_current_filters over that
    prefix, so the two can never drift on what "a filter is on" means.

    bound_ms is a hover's client-side interactionAt (epoch ms). A response_list entry
    carries its own client timestamp under input_data.interactionAt (the same clock as
    the hover), which is how the two lists -- filters live only in response_list, hovers

    minimal unit records) means "no bound" -> every filter, identical to get_current_

    so untimestamped test records behave as they did before this change.

    app_mode is threaded straight through to get_current_filters, which needs it to
    decide whether a filter_changed actually CONSTRAINS its attribute (study spec item 9)

    variable can never look ready on dwell its own score never sees. Before this, the
    score read dc_metric.dwell_by_teen -- the GLOBAL pooled dwell -- so hovers made while
    v was inactive still weighted v's score.

    own; and one variable's dwell never advances another's clock.

    Each checkable variable is then scored INDEPENDENTLY: DC is re-pooled onto that ONE
    variable and its DwellBias is scored against a null built from THAT variable's own
    per-teen dwell. Ready variables are never pooled into a joint score -- two variables
    that disagree no longer cancel each other out, and a variable is judged only on the
    attention it actually received. The winner is then the priority hierarchy's
    (_reduce_by_priority, shared with the selection trigger): threshold first, then axis-
    tier > filter-tier > confidence > percentile > name. The raw score's sign is NOT
    gated: a high enough percentile fires even when DwellBias is negative (the
    positive-score requirement was removed in pilot round 2).

    Display pause vs per-variable spacing: these are two DIFFERENT mechanisms, layered.
    The per-variable gate below counts ACCUMULATED ELIGIBLE DWELL (only advances while
    hovering with that variable active); the system gate is not a clock at all -- it is
    simply CLOSED for as long as a panel is believed to be up (llm_panel_open_since set).
    It is placed BEFORE any scoping/scoring so a suppressed check does no work and --
    critically -- mutates NO cooldown state: dwell_last_checked_by_var and
    dwell_last_fired_vars are left exactly as if scoring never ran, so nothing "earns"
    toward the next fire while a panel is displayed.

    KNOWN, ACCEPTED CONSEQUENCE of dropping the wall clock: on a manual early close, the
    per-variable spacing is now the only thing separating two interventions. The variable
    that fired was rebased by reset_dwell_watermark and so still owes DWELL_RECHECK_
    SECONDS of new eligible dwell -- but a variable that was SCORED AND LOST keeps its
    recheck budget by design (see below), so if it was already eligible before the
    dismiss it can fire immediately, with no wall-clock gap. The old 30s floor concealed
    that. This is the behaviour the study lead asked for, not an oversight: the pause
    is meant to track the panel, and once the panel is gone there is nothing left to wait for.

    Side effect -- dwell_last_checked_by_var[v], in v's OWN eligible-seconds units.
    Confirmed with the study lead, and asymmetric between the two outcomes:
      * ON FIRE, only the WINNING variable's clock advances, and dwell_last_fired_vars
        holds exactly [winner]. The variables that were scored but lost were not what the
        intervention was about, so that evaluation must not spend their recheck budget.
      * ON A NON-FIRE, every variable actually SCORED this call has its clock advanced
        ("after each check, we just want to accumulate additional 10s dwell time for that
        variable when it is active"), which is what keeps the recheck spacing working for
        non-winners. Variables excluded before sampling (the degenerate guard) are NOT
        advanced -- nothing about them was meaningfully evaluated.
    A call blocked by an earlier gate mutates nothing at all. On fire, the caller
    (on_interaction) opens the display pause (open_display_pause) and pins the
    intervention's message to trace["target_var"].

    client_record: the CLIENTS[pid] dict (reads bias_logs / response_list /
                   dc_map_detailed / dwell_last_checked_by_var / llm_panel_open_since).
    dwell_metrics: the dict from dc_adapter.compute_dwell_metrics, i.e.
                   {"dwell_bias", "dwell_bias_v", "n_dwelled"}.
    now_ms:        current wall-clock time in epoch ms (bias_util.get_current_time()'s
                   unit), passed in by the caller so this module imports no clock and
                   its tests stay deterministic. The display pause itself needs no clock
                   -- an open pause suppresses either way -- but its stale-flag watchdog
                   does, so None (no clock supplied) can only suppress, never recover.
                   The live path always passes it.

    differences follow from dwell not being selection:

      * the weights are PER VARIABLE. v is scored against dwell_by_var[v] -- the teens
        hovered while v was active, and only those -- not against one shared global
        dwell. k and the total dwell budget the null is drawn with therefore also come
        from v's own history, so the null matches the score's scale.
      * scoping to a single variable makes w_v cancel exactly (Sum w_v*C_v / Sum w_v over
        one term is C_v), so these percentiles are scored on the RAW per-variable
        consistency with no js-weighting anywhere in the path. That is the study's
        "use VC_v, not VC_v x w_v" -- it falls out of the restructuring rather than
        needing a flag.

    scope_vars is the caller's already-intersected list of ready BELIEF variables, so a
    scoped_detailed_map failure here means an internally inconsistent map rather than a
    non-belief attribute; it is caught per variable (excluding just that one) rather than
    lost the whole check, the same handler-boundary posture on_interaction takes.

    rng is the ONE seeded generator the caller builds per evaluation (dc_adapter.
    live_rng()), advanced across the loop so each variable draws an independent null;

# Progressive selection gate.
#
# A non-blocking, per-selection sibling of the realtime dwell trigger, scoring the
# running selection instead of dwell and PER VARIABLE instead of pooled, firing on
# the single most extreme variable (the study's rule). Reached live only through
# evaluate_selection_trigger above, whose pick-counted cooldown keeps it from
# firing on every selection past the 5th.

def evaluate_selection_progressive_trigger(client_record, selected_ids):
    """Per-variable selection-bias fire decision for the running selection.

    Sibling of evaluate_trigger (the realtime dwell gate) in shape -- a readiness
    gate first, then the scoped scoring -- and, like it, scored only on the CURRENTLY
    ACTIVE variables (see SCOPE below), but on the SELECTION rather than dwell.

    Returns a dict. Below readiness / no active variables:
      {"ready": False, "reason": "not_ready (...)" | "no_active_vars",
       "n_selected", "percentile_by_var": None, "excluded_vars": {}}
    At/above readiness with an active variable set:
      {"ready":             True,
       "reason":            "ok",
       "fired":             bool,
       "target_var":        variable | None,   # the winning variable, only on a fire
       "target_percentile": float | None,      # its percentile, only on a fire
       "n_selected":        int,                # unique selected ids
       "percentile_by_var": {variable: percentile},   # full dict, for logging
       "excluded_vars":     {variable: code}}         # dropped before sampling

    SCOPE (study rule, mirroring the dwell trigger): only the CURRENTLY ACTIVE
    variables are scored -- the x/y axis attributes plus any attribute with an active
    filter (get_current_axes | get_current_filters, the same active set the dwell
    trigger scopes on). The pre-scoping behavior scored every belief variable; now a
    variable the participant is not looking at or filtering on can neither earn nor
    block a fire. An empty active set is treated like dwell's no_visible_axes guard:
    not-ready, no scoring attempted.

    Reduction (the study's PRIORITY HIERARCHY): delegated to _reduce_by_priority, the
    threshold-then-rank helper this gate SHARES with the dwell trigger -- threshold
    first, then axis-tier > filter-tier > confidence > percentile > name. See that
    function for the ordering and why it is that way. This gate contributes only its
    own threshold (SELECTION_PERCENTILE_THRESHOLD) and its axis/filter split.
    fired = the candidate set is non-empty; target_var / target_percentile name the
    winner (or None/None when nothing cleared). percentile_by_var is always returned
    in full so a log can show how close it got. Variables whose percentile is None
    (nothing selected present in the map -- uniform across variables) never enter the
    candidate set. A total miss (active vars present but none are belief variables)
    yields an empty percentile_by_var via the intersection in
    selection_percentile_by_var, which reduces to fired=False -- no separate path.

    Readiness: n_selected >= MIN_SELECTIONS, which is what makes this "start at
    the 5th selection."

                   bias_logs / response_list via get_current_axes / get_current_filters).
