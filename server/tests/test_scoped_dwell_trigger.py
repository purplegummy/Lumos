"""Synthetic validation harness for the PER-VARIABLE dwell trigger.

Standalone -- no real elicitation, no sockets, no live server path. Run it as:

    cd server && python3 test_scoped_dwell_trigger.py    # needs numpy (the venv)

Covers the pieces behind the per-variable dwell trigger:

  * dc_adapter.scoped_detailed_map -- re-pools each teen's DC over just the requested
    variables from their stored consistency/weights, leaving the input map intact.
  * llm_trigger.eligible_dwell_by_teen_by_var / eligible_dwell_seconds_by_var /
    filters_active_as_of -- the per-variable eligible-dwell replay: each variable
    accrues only the hover time spent WHILE IT WAS ACTIVE (its own axes as of that
    hover + filters as of that hover), kept PER TEEN so the gates and the scorer read
    the same numbers.
  * llm_trigger.evaluate_trigger -- readiness (a variable's own eligible dwell >=
    MIN_ELIGIBLE_DWELL_SECONDS), recheck spacing (DWELL_RECHECK_SECONDS of NEW eligible
    dwell for that variable) AND scoring are ALL per-variable. Every ready variable gets
    its OWN percentile, scored against its OWN per-teen dwell; ready variables are never
    pooled into one joint score. The winner is the shared priority hierarchy's, and only
    the winner's cooldown advances on a fire. MIN_UNIQUE_HOVERS is gone.
  * the degenerate-null guard -- a variable whose per-teen DC is constant would score a
    guaranteed 1.0 against a collapsed null, so it is dropped before sampling.

Mirrors test_dc_metric.py's pattern (a nonlocal `check`, pure asserts + prints,
exits non-zero on failure). It does NOT touch the existing get_current_axes tests
(test_llm_intervention.py) or the pooled percentile tests (test_dc_metric.py);
both keep passing unchanged.
