"""Synthetic validation harness for PER-VARIABLE eligible selection sets (items 7-8).

Standalone -- no sockets, no live server path. Run it as:

    cd server && python3 test_scoped_selection.py      # needs numpy (the venv)

A selection is evidence about the variable the participant was LOOKING AT WHEN THEY
MADE IT. Scoring every variable against one global selection attributes every pick to
every variable at once, so a variable inherits picks made while it was nowhere in view.

Covers:
  * llm_trigger.eligible_selection_by_var -- the replay: attribution FIXED at add time
    from the event's own axes + the filters constraining as of that event, deselection
    removing UNCONDITIONALLY (not re-derived from what is active now), re-selection
    earning a fresh tag, and click_group's toggle semantics.
  * dc_adapter.selection_percentile_by_var's selected_by_var -- per-variable scoring,
    and that omitting it leaves the pooled/shared behaviour byte-identical.
  * the wiring through evaluate_selection_progressive_trigger, whose readiness and
    checkpoint schedule stay on the GLOBAL pick count.

Mirrors test_dc_metric.py's pattern (a nonlocal `check`, pure asserts + prints, exits
non-zero on failure). Touches none of the existing suites.
