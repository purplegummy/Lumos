"""Synthetic validation harness for CONSTRAINT-AWARE filter activity (study spec item 9).

Standalone -- no sockets, no live server path. Run it as:

    cd server && python3 test_filter_activity.py       # needs the venv (scipy via bias)

"Active filter" used to mean "switched on at some point": filter_changed added
unconditionally and only an explicit removal ever took an attribute back out. It now
means the filter is actually EXCLUDING ROWS -- a change back to the full range or the
full category set DEACTIVATES the attribute again.

That deactivate-on-unconstrain transition is the whole point and it is also brand new:
no pilot data exercises it, because until now no code path could produce it. So the
replays here are deliberately synthetic and walk the full activate -> deactivate ->
reactivate cycle rather than sampling a single state.

Covers:
  * llm_intervention._attribute_domain     -- reading a dataset's full domain out of
    bias.DATA_MAP's precomputed distribution (numeric ends / categorical key set).
  * llm_intervention._filter_is_constraining -- the per-type comparison, including the
    "cannot tell -> assume constraining" fallback that keeps every pre-existing
    minimal-record test meaning what it did before.
  * llm_intervention.get_current_filters   -- the replay, its three app_mode resolution
    paths, and llmTheme parity.
  * llm_trigger.filters_active_as_of       -- that the time-bounded view INHERITS all of
    the above through delegation, with no rules of its own.

Mirrors test_dc_metric.py's pattern (a nonlocal `check`, pure asserts + prints, exits
non-zero on failure). Touches none of the existing suites.
