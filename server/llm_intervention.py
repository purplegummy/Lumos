"""LLM intervention for the confirmation-bias study's "LLM" condition.

Ported from the reviewed proof of concept (bias_signal_assembler.py +
confirmation_bias_llm_generator.py). The SYSTEM_PROMPT, OUTPUT_SCHEMA, tone
constraints, theme construction and input shape are the experimental stimulus
and are reproduced verbatim -- do not reword them.

Two halves:
  1. Assembly -- turn the pre-computed signals (dwell_bias_v, diagnosis focus,
     and the bin x group candidate cells from dc_metric.bin_group_candidates)
     into the structured "LLM input" the prompt expects. Both the summary and the
     recommendation read the same grid, so they name ranges from the participant's
     OWN belief bins and always concern the same variable.
  2. Generation -- call Claude (claude-sonnet-5, low effort) with a
     schema-enforced JSON response.

Follows firebase_logger's "no-op when unconfigured" pattern: if
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is absent the client init prints one message and disables the
feature. A missing key (or any failure) never raises and never affects the
CONTROL / AWARENESS / ADMIN conditions.

than a live nudge (e.g. "Before you submit, ..."). Produce one recommended_theme per candidate_theme \
given, in the same order, each one's filter_ranges copied through exactly as given.

If phase is "balanced_check", the participant's final selection is NOT skewed, so there is nothing to \
correct and the candidate_themes are context only -- do not recommend them. Use awareness_summary to \
recap what they explored, grounded the same way, and say their selection looks relatively balanced for \
building a story. Let the transition offer a last look as optional rather than as a fix (e.g. "You can \
take another look, or submit as they are."). Return "recommended_themes": [].
