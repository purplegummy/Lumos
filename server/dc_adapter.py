"""Adapter + integration glue between Prasit's stored priors and the DC metric.

This module is deliberately SEPARATE from the validated math in dc_metric.py.
dc_metric.py is frozen (its unit-tested functions must not change); everything
here is reshape/plumbing that can evolve without touching the math.

Prasit's merge stores priors as:

    CLIENTS[pid]["priors"]["{attribute}::{condition}"] = PriorBelief

where condition in {'diagnosed', 'not_diagnosed'} and each PriorBelief is one
group's distribution:

    { attribute, condition, binEdges, counts, ballCount, confidence,
      categories?  (present => categorical) }

dc_metric expects, per variable, ONE contract object:

    { attribute,
      binEdges | categories,                       # shared across the two groups
      countsByGroup: {
          diagnosed:    { counts, confidence },
          nonDiagnosed: { counts, confidence } } }

build_beliefs_from_priors() performs that reshape. See its docstring for the
completeness guard (d) and the shared-bins assertion (e).
